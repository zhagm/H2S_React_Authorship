\chapter{Introduction}

When a user opens a webpage, views the images, reads the content, and clicks the links, they are interacting with the front-end (or client-side) of the website. Front-end developers write the code to create views, essentially bridge the connection between a regular person on their browser, and the API’s, services, and content that are being served on the backend. We have now created a backend server, but what can we do with it other than use postman to make requests? Your grandma wouldn’t be able able to use postman, make requests, and send the necessary body parameters. And even if she could, she wouldn’t want to. That’s where this project comes in. Having a good user interface is important in making a website useable. We’ll be learning the essentials of front-end using React.js and creating a view for your to-do list app.

What is React.js? React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook in 2011, and is currently open-sourced and supported by Facebook and a big community of supporters.

\chapter{General instructions}

We'll start with setting up our environment and making sure Node and NPM are up to date on our monitors using NVM (Node Version Manager). Once we have that set up, we'll start with building our first app.

We'll be building a front-end for our To-do list API from the Node.js project. In this course, we'll be focusing purely on the front-end side of the website so you'll want to have deployed your API to heroku beforehand. If you have not done this, you'll be asked to go back and do so in the Lifecycle Methods section of this PDF.

After we walk through and build our To-do list app, you'll be using your new skills to build a project of your choice.

\chapter{Exercise \exercicenumber: Setting up our Environment}

Before we get started, we need to make sure a few things are up-to-date on our monitors. Normally, when working on your own computer where you have admin rights you wouldn't have to go through these steps. You would be able to just npm i -g (global install) the necessary packages and run from there. The monitors at the school are protected though, and we don't have admin access, so we'll be working around that by using NVM, which is a Node Version Manager.



\begin{42jscode}
// Server.js
const express = require("express")

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    console.log("Hello world!");
    res.status(200).send("Hello world");
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
$
\end{42jscode}

\info {
    Check out \href{https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/}
    {this link} for more information on npm.
}

\newpage
	Let's setup our start script. Open up \texttt{package.json} and under the scripts object replace \texttt{"test"} with \texttt{"start"} and then replace the script's value with the command \texttt{"node server.js"}. Your package.json should look like this:

\begin{42jscode}
{
    "name": "basics",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node server.js"
    },
    "author": "Don Stolz",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.16.4"
    }
}
\end{42jscode}

	Finally our server is ready to run. From the root of your \texttt{Basics} project run \texttt{npm run start} and head to \href{http://localhost:3000/}{http://localhost:3000/} to check out your server.

    \hint {
        Use "control + c" to quit your server.
    }

\chapter{Exercise \exercicenumber: Setting up additional endpoints}

    Now that we have our basic server setup we can start adding more endpoints to expand our functionalty. What is an endpoint? An endpoint is a URL pattern used to communicate with an API. Endpoints can also be differntiated by their HTTP methods. An HTTP method allows us to indicate the type of action we are trying to preform. Our current server consists of a single `GET` endpoint.

\info {
		Check out \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods}{MDN}
		for more information on the different types of HTTP methods.
	}

    Let's first add a database so that we have some information for our new endpoints to access. Create a file called \texttt{"db.json"} in this file create a simple array of user objects with the fields \texttt{"name"} and \texttt{"id"}. It should look something like this.
\begin{42jscode}
[
    {
        "name": "Don",
        "id": 0
    },
    {
        "name": "Dan",
        "id": 1
    }
]
\end{42jscode}

    Now we can access our database by importing it the same way we imported the express library. Simply add \texttt{const db = require("./db.json");} to the top of our \texttt{server.js} file.

    Setup a new `GET` endpoint called \texttt{"/users"}. It will be setup simarly to our `Hello World!` example, except it will return our database:
\begin{42jscode}
// Get all users
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send(db);
});
\end{42jscode}

    Notice that along with the response we send back we also set the status code to 200. Status code 200 indicates that the request has succeeded. Check out the different status code values \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status}{here} 

    Next, we will setup a route to retrieve an individual user from our database. Setup another `GET` endpoint and call it \texttt{"/users/:id"}. Using \texttt{":id"} will allow us to retrieve \texttt{"id"} as a variable from the request parameters. Follow the snippet below:
\begin{42jscode}
// Get user by ID
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
    const { id } = req.params;

    const user = db.find(item => item.id == id);
    if (user) {
        res.status(200).send(user);
    } else {
        res.status(404).send("Could not find user");
    }
});
\end{42jscode}

    Notice the new status code 404. This indicates an error, specifically that the server could not find the requested resources. Try testing your endpoints by going to \href{http://localhost:3000/users}{http://localhost:3000/users} and \href{http://localhost:3000/users/0}{http://localhost:3000/users/0}

\chapter{Exercise \exercicenumber: Setting up POST endpoints}

    We can fetch our entire db and individual users, now we will learn how to set up a `POST` endpoint so we can add new users to our database. In order to do this we will be adding a few additonal libraries. First run \texttt{npm install --save body-parser}. Then add the body-parser middleware to our express app. We will also be adding the \texttt{"fs"} library to access the file system, this library comes with Node. The top of your \texttt{server.js} file should look like this:

\begin{42jscode}
    // Server.js
    const express = require("express");
    const db = require("./db.json");
    const fs = require("fs");
    const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
    const app = express();

    // Add bodyparsing middleware to app
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
\end{42jscode}
\newpage
    Set up a new `POST` endpoint called \texttt{"/users"}, this will be exactly the same as our `GET` route except we will use \texttt{app.get('/users')}. In this route we will also be pulling the \texttt{"name"} variable out of \texttt{"req.body"}, this is what we setup the \texttt{"body-parser"} middleware for. We will check that name exists, if it doesn't we will return a \texttt{400} status. Next we will setup the new user object and assign it's \texttt{name} and \texttt{id} values. Once we have the object setup, we can push it to the database. However, simply push the new value to the database will not update the file itself. We will have to first convert our JSON array into a string, then use the \texttt{fs} module to write the stringified database to our JSON file. Follow this example:
\begin{42jscode}
    // Create new user
    app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
        const { name } = req.body;
        if (!name) {
            res.status(400).send("Could not add user");
        }
        let user = {};
        user.name = name;
        user.id = db.length;
        db.push(user);
        // Convert DB to JSON string
        data = JSON.stringify(db);
        // Write string to file
        fs.writeFile("./db.json", data, "utf8", err => {
            if (err) {
            res.status(404).send(`Failed to add ${user.name} to db`);
            }
            res.status(200).send(`Added ${user.name} to db`);
        });
    });
\end{42jscode}

\chapter{Exercise \exercicenumber: Testing with Postman}

    So we've setup a `POST` route, but how do we send data with our request? We will be using a tool called Postman to test our routes. Head to the Application directory and open Postman, or use  `command + space` and search Postman.

    Feel free to login with google or head straight to the app. Once you are inside you can quickly test our `GET` requests by add \texttt{localhost:3000} as the `request URL` like so:

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=14cm]{WEB/postman_GET.png}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

Now that we know how to setup a `GET` request we can setup our `POST` request in a similar way. Here we will also want to add a body for sending the name of the user to add. We will head to the \texttt{body} tab and select \texttt{raw} as our format. Next we will also need to specify that our data is \texttt{JSON content}. Then we can add create a JSON object to add a new user. You should get a response that says \texttt{"Added New User to db"} with a status of \texttt{200}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=14cm]{WEB/postman_POST.png}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

\hint {
		logging in with Google will allow you to save your routes which we will come in handy when your testing the Mandatory parts.
	}

The final tool you will want to add to your project before starting the Mandatory Parts is nodemon. Nodemon is a development tool that will automatically refresh our server whenever we make file changes, this way we will avoid having to manually shutdown and restart our server everytime we make changes. To add nodemon run \texttt{npm install --save-dev nodemon}. Then open your package.json file. Add a new script called \texttt{"start-watch"} and give it the value \texttt{"nodemon server.js"}. Now we can run \texttt{npm run start-watch} and nodemon will take care of refreshing our server. Your \texttt{package.json} file should look like this:
\begin{42jscode}
{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "start-watch": "nodemon server.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
    "express": "^4.16.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^1.18.10"
  }
}

Now you are equiped with enough knowledge and tools to build your own API. You will be building an API to keep track of Todos. Your endpoints should be as followed:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt
\item GET \texttt{"/todos"} -> Gets all Todos in database
\item GET \texttt{"/todos/:id"} -> Gets single Todo by ID
\item POST \texttt{"/todos"} -> Add new Todo to database
\item POST \texttt{"/todos/:id"} -> Update single Todo by ID
\item DELETE \texttt{"/todos/:id"} -> Delete single Todo by ID
\end{itemize}

Use a \texttt{db.json} like we did in our previous example for storage.

\chapter{Mandatory part 2}

Now that we are pros at writing APIs we will connect our API to a proper database instance. Your challenge will be to \texttt{FIRST COPY} your existing API, then replace our current file system database with a newly setup Mongo database.\\

\texttt{First} follow the MongoDB PDF for instructions on setting up a cloud instance of MongoDB.\\

Once we have our DB setup, we can set up Mongoose. Mongoose is an Object Document Modeler, it allows us to define a schema and easily connect to MongoDB. We will install it using \texttt{npm install --save mongoose} and require it at the top as usual. Then we can add the following snippet to connect our API to MongoDB through 

\begin{42jscode}
	// Connect to MongoDB
	mongoose.connect("mongodb+srv://dstolz:42marvin@cluster0-4bipl.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true",
	{ useNewUrlParser: true }
	);
	
	// Test MongoDB connection
	const connection = mongoose.connection;
	connection.once("open", function() {
		console.log("MongoDB database connection established successfully");
		});
	\end{42jscode}
	
	In order to use MongoDB with Mongoose we will also have to create a schema. Create a seperate file called \texttt{todo.model.js} and add the following code:
	
	\begin{42jscode}
		const mongoose = require("mongoose");
		const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
		
		let Todo = new Schema({
			task: {
				type: String,
				required: true
				},
				completed: {
					type: Boolean,
					required: true
					}
					});
					
					module.exports = mongoose.model("Todo", Todo);
				\end{42jscode}
				
				We can import our todo model at the top of our \texttt{server.js} file.
				\begin{42jscode}
					const Todo = require("./todo.schema");
				\end{42jscode}
				
				\newpage
				
				Head to the \href{https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html}{Getting Started} section of the mongoose docs to learn more.
				
				\hint {
					Check out the \href{https://bit.ly/2T1PWuF}{Mongoose model API docs}
